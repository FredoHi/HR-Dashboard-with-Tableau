## Introduction

Bic Limited, an e-commerce and retail chain enterprise, aspires to emerge as the primary player in the trade and commerce sector across the continent. Lately, the company's retention rate of employees has emerged as a significant source of concern for both the management and stakeholders. In response to this challenge, the HR manager approached me for assistance in conducting an in-depth analysis of their HR datasets.

The primary aim of this analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the attrition rate within the company's workforce. The dataset furnished valuable insights into employee demographics, salary distribution, and attrition rates, all of which contributed to the formulation of meaningful conclusions and recommendations for the company.

## Introduction

Bic Limited, an e-commerce and retail chain enterprise, aspires to emerge as the primary player in the trade and commerce sector across the continent. Lately, the company's retention rate of employees has emerged as a significant source of concern for both the management and stakeholders. In response to this challenge, the HR manager approached me for assistance in conducting an in-depth analysis of their HR datasets.

The primary aim of this analysis was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the attrition rate within the company's workforce. The dataset furnished valuable insights into employee demographics, salary distribution, and attrition rates, all of which contributed to the formulation of meaningful conclusions and recommendations for the company.

A comprehensive evaluation of the dataset was conducted to identify potential data quality issues and structural anomalies that might necessitate cleaning. However, it is noteworthy that no such issues were detected within the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis EDA

## Findings/Result

- The total number of employees in the company is 1470, with 882 of them being male and 588 being female. Out of these, 1233 employees are currently active.
- The total attrition in the company is 237, with the average salary being $6503. This average salary is slightly higher for female employees ($6700) compared to male employees ($6400).
- Among the different departments, the R&D department has the highest average salary. Male employees in this department earn $3,567,595 while female employees earn $2,468,689.

## Recommendation

- Given the total attrition of 237 employees, it is crucial to implement attrition management strategies. Focus on understanding the factors leading to attrition, particularly in the age group of 25-34, where the attrition rate is the highest.

- Recognize the gender pay gap, with male employees earning lower on average than their female counterparts. Ensure equitable compensation practices to address this discrepancy.

- Investigate the reasons behind the varying average salaries among departments, especially the significant difference in the R&D department. This can help in optimizing salary structures and promoting fairness.

- Recognize that single employees have the highest attrition rate. Explore the factors contributing to this trend and consider initiatives to enhance their job satisfaction and engagement.

- Given that employees with Bachelor's degrees have a higher attrition rate, assess the reasons behind this and implement strategies such as career development programs or mentorship to retain this group.

- Focus on strategies to reduce the overall attrition rate for male employees, which is significantly higher than that of female employees. This may include understanding the specific challenges male employees face and tailoring retention efforts accordingly.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis report sheds light on various critical aspects of the company's workforce, encompassing employee demographics, attrition rates, and salary distribution. The findings underscore the need for a holistic approach to human resource management, emphasizing attrition reduction, gender pay equity, departmental dynamics, age-related incentives, and support for employees with different marital and educational backgrounds. By acting upon these insights, the company can enhance its overall employee satisfaction and retention, fostering a more inclusive and productive work environment.
